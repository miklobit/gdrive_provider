about= GooGIS is an experimental plugin derivated from pseudo_csv_provider by @g-sherman. It keeps syncronization between a local memory layer and a remote google drive sheet and provides a simple peer to peer cloud environment for sharing and editing geospatial contents with other users. It’s only required a valid Google account.
